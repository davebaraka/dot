Frustrated with the lack of academic and decentralized social information on campus, OurCampus was created as a medium for students at Wesleyan University to share events, rate professors, and engage in the community. OurCampus is availalbe as both an iOS and android on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.

# The start of the project

Before I joined the initiaitve, OurCampus was a natively built iOS app supported by two ambitious friends. Sadly, design and user experience was the least of their worries, but their efforts in development and marketing were inspiring and tremendous.

# Novice designer and developer 

I joined to design and engineer the android counterpart in 2019 using native tools. I first started off using Java, then I switched to the more development-friendly language - Kotlin, with Firebase as our backend service. Unfortunately, I focused on trying to get things perfect for the first release - completely erasing and rewriting my code several times (Oh, and whatâ€™s Figma, Adobe XD, and Sketch?) ðŸ˜© And well, these were the results...

At the time, I thought it was great. Some responsize sizing issues - not to hard to fix. **That was until I watched a student install the app and use it for the first time.** I knew I messed up just for an unengaging, complex user interface that uses both a hamburger menu and bottom navigation bar that has tech savy students lost ðŸ˜•

# Back at again with the same mistakes 

Still ignorant of design tools that could have saved me months of time, I jumped back into the code for another month or so. With the data I collected from **observing students using the app and researching different mobile interfaces,** I introuduced a more focused interface. Despite an improved but far from ideal user experience, the next release was plagued by bugs, like improper handling of database errors. We learn and we grow...

# And now... 

I was frustrated with the **lack of source of truth with the design** and the discrepancies between the android and iOS app. We were also tired of the time it takes to incorporate new features for each platform, where we were only two developers. As a solution, I proposed a cross platform development framework called Flutter (over React Native), in hopes of increasing design and developement time. I took it upon myself to redesign and build both the iOS and android app using Flutter.

In a year long effort with Flutter and our future plans of expanding our team with researchers, designers, and developers, I researched scalable code architecture and design patterns, and also fostered a **design system** for OurCampus that inherits from Googleâ€™s Material Deisgn and Appleâ€™s Human Interface Guidelines, to build an iOS and android app that feels and looks native to their respective platforms.

With a scalable code architecture and a design system as a foundation, we are now ready to invest in new features, and **iterate** and improve on an existing experience. My goal is to empower designers and developers of the Wesleyan community to continue to support OurCampus and propel an experience that **empathizes** with the student.
