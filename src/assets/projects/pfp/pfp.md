PrivacyFlash Pro analyzes the code of iOS Swift projects to generate a privacy policy. It was built as an academic project of the privacy-tech-lab at Wesleyan University.

# From the terminal

When I joined the privacy-tech-lab, PrivacyFlash Pro was an unnamed tool that performed static analysis to analyze iOS Swift projects and generate a privacy report. Developers could run the tool from the terminal on their iOS projects and create a report identifying various privacy practices. At this time, I was inexeperienced with software technologies and development, but I had a founding passion in design and user experience. With a shift in outlook to generate a privacy policy, I thought - "How can we make this experience engaging to developers?"

# Introduce a GUI

In the next iteration, we wanted to include a GUI. Exploring various techonologies, it seemed that web tools were the most promising for this task. Some of the requirements for this interation was to include a wizard and a view of the privacy policy. We also wanted to be able to simultaneoulsy edit a privacy policy and see the results.

My main design tool was pencil and paper. I didn't know about Adobe XD, Sketch, Figma, and other design tools. After a few inital mockups as a team, I sought to make this idea come to life. During the sketching phase, I was unware of the motion, transitions, and interactions we may take for granted in applications that makes an experience whole. Another challenge was how to structure and layer content. Through research, closely inspecting other software applications, and countless educational videos, I built an improved experience over accessing the tool in the terminal - connecting the 'backend' python analysis to the front-end (html, css, javascript).

To bring it all together, we also wanted to package the tool so that a developer could just download and run the privacy policy generator. From creating Mac OS icons to designing and building the onboarding experience, we created a much improved desktop application available to the community.
