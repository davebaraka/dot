# Graphic Design

Graphic Design explores methods for visual communication â€” thinking and making through text, image, and the interaction of the two. Below features a recreated book jacket from the book _Things Not Seen_ by Andrew Clements, a brochure, a traditional wine label, a modern wine label, an american wine label, and finally an advocacy poster.
